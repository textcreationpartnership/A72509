            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In commendation of this booke, vpon a fit occaſion, the like in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,<note place="margin">Alexander Neuil, Norwicus.</note> is in Latine lately written by a Gentleman of our Countrie, knowne
<pb facs="tcp:151978:4"/> to be very honest, and, I thinke, very well learned: and ſo vnder the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of his good iudgement, may I (without blame) the more boldly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it vnto you.</p>
            <p>What vtilitie foloweth the ſtudie of Hystories, many of them haue well declared that haue publiſhed hysto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by theim ſelfes, or haue ſet out Hyſtories written by others. And therefore already ſufficiently done, I neede not (vnlearned mee ſelfe, I can not) therein ſay muche. And yet thus much I may breefely ſay, and fit for the thing I haue in hande (me thinketh) I muste needes ſay, that (the ſacred word of Almightie God alwayes excepted) there is nothing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our instruction more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or to our mindes more delectable, or within the compaſſe of common vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding more eaſie or facile, then
<pb facs="tcp:151978:4"/> the ſtudie of hystories: nor that ſtudie for none estate more meete, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the estate of Gentlemen: nor for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Englande, no Hystorie ſo meete, as the Hystorie of England. For, the dexteritie that men haue ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in prouiding for theimſelfes, or in comforting their freendes (two very good things) or in ſeruing their King and Countrie (of all outward things, the best thing) doth rest cheefly vpon their awne &amp; other folks experience: which I may aſſuredly accompt (for,<note place="margin">Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Moore Knight, in the hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of King Richard the thirde.</note> in an hyſtorie, in our tong as wel written as any thing euer was, or I thinke euer ſhalbe, <hi>great experience</hi> deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a proofe of two ſuch things, as proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and aduerſitie be, vpon a fit occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder the perſon of a very wiſema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is rightly accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted) to be the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and maiſtres of wiſdome. Now that that a number of folkes doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
<pb facs="tcp:151978:5"/> is much more then that, that any one of vs can do ſpecially, and ſo by other folks experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, are we taught largely: and that, that other folkes for their King, their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, theimſelfes, their friends, like good men do vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, ought to prouoke vs with good de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uotion inwardly to loue theim: &amp; with good words openly much to commende theim, and in their vertuous actions, rightly to folow theim. And that, that other folkes againſt their King, their countrie, their friends (and ſo againſt theim ſelfes) like fooliſh men do igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, or like leude men do wickedly, ought to moue vs firſt (as our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) Chriſtianly to bewaile theim: and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as by preſidents of peril pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured through their awne follies and faults) dutifully and wiſely to beware by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſettle our ſelues, as it were, in a ſeate of ſuretie. Thus you ſee what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth, and thus you ſee where other folkes experience is to be had: which, for the good eſtate of England (reſting chiefly vpon the good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſeruice of the Gentlemen of England) is as J thinke, moſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fet from the Hyſtorie of England.

            <p>At the time of this mariage, <hi>Hengiſt</hi> (labouring by all meanes to bring in his owne Countrie men) begged of the King the territories of <hi>Kent, Eſſex, Midleſex,</hi> and <hi>Suffolke,</hi> (then knowen by other names) pretending in woord, that he would, in conſideration thereof, kéep out <hi>Aurel.

            <head>¶ A short counſell, as touching the Bryttiſhe hyſtorie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit that I am iuſtly occaſioned (before I make myne entrie) to ſpeake largely, for confirmation of the credite of oure <hi>Bryttiſhe</hi> or <hi>Welſhe hyſtorie,</hi> (the faith wherof is by <hi>William Petite,</hi> and <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore Virgile</hi> called into queſtion) for as muche, as I ſhal be enforced to vſe it as a ground worke of my whole frame and building: yet for that I mynde not in any part of this my labour, to handle with many wordes, matters in controuerſie, (being otherwiſe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently charged with things more incident to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and no leſſe fit to be knowne.) And bycauſe alſo that matter hath alreadie founde more learned and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent <hi>patrones,</hi> I will with fewe wordes paſſe it ouer, contenting my ſelfe, if I ſhall haue added to other mens heapes, one ſmall proofe or twaine, whiche by chaunce I gleaned after them, and referring ſuche as deſire more aboundant teſtimonies, to the reading of <hi>Iohn Leland,</hi> and Syr <hi>Iohn ap Reſe,</hi> two learned men, that haue plen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifully written therein.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the matter is this, whether <hi>Geffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouthe</hi>
               <note place="margin">Geffray of Monmouth</note> be the authour of the <hi>Bryttiſh</hi> ſtorie (as <hi>William Newborow,</hi> and <hi>Polydore</hi> charge him) or the <hi>tranſlatour</hi> thereof onely out of the <hi>Bryttiſhe,</hi> as him ſelfe in his booke profeſſeth. Whereof muſt néedes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, That if the worke be his owne, it hath no more credite, then he him ſelfe (being the author) coulde bring vnto it: But if he did only tranſlate that, whiche <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the <hi>Archdeacon</hi> of <hi>Oxforde</hi> brought out of <hi>Norma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> and deliuered vnto him, Then doth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſtimation
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:151978:44"/> depende vpon <hi>Geffray,</hi> but vpon ſome other (wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he were) that firſt wrate it.</p>
            <p>Now, that it may appeare vnto you, that he was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the interpreter of that whiche came out of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> I will call to witneſſe, <hi>Henrie</hi> the <hi>Archdeacon</hi> of <hi>Huntington,</hi> who liued in the time of <hi>king Henrie</hi> the firſt, and was ſomwhat before <hi>William Petites</hi> dayes, who (as him ſelf confeſſeth) was borne in the beginning of the reigne of <hi>king Stephan,</hi> about whiche time <hi>Gef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray</hi> of <hi>Monmouthe</hi> was on liue alſo.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Henrie</hi> (beſides a learned hyſtorie of the realme) wrate thrée ſeuerall <hi>treatiſes</hi> whiche I haue ſéene: One intituled, <hi>De miraculis Angliae:</hi> An other, <hi>De ſerie Regu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> potentiſſimorum:</hi> And the thirde, <hi>De origine Regum Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannorum.</hi> In this latter, he ſayth playnly. That at ſuch time as he trauayled towardes <hi>Rome,</hi> he founde (in an auncient Librarie of the <hi>Abbay</hi> of <hi>Bec</hi>) an olde booke, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled likewiſe, <hi>De origine Regum Brytannoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the which beginning at the arriuall of <hi>Brute,</hi> ended with the actes of <hi>Cadwalader,</hi> and agréed thoroughout (as by collatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I collected) with this our <hi>Bryttiſhe</hi> hyſtorie, which I doubt whether <hi>Henrie</hi> of <hi>Huntington</hi> had euer ſéene. Nowe therefore, if this were an olde booke in his time, it coulde not be newe in the dayes of <hi>Petite,</hi> that ſuccéeded him: And if the argument were written before in the <hi>Bryt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> tongue, it is very probable, that he was not the firſt author, but only the tranſlator thereof in <hi>Latine.</hi> For further likelyhoode whereof, I my ſelfe haue an aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Bryttiſh,</hi> or <hi>Welſhe</hi> copy, which I reſerue for ſhew, and doe reuerence for the antiquitie, litle doubting, but that it was written before the dayes of <hi>William Petite,</hi> who, as he was the firſt, So vpon the matter recken I him the onely man, that euer impugned the <hi>Bryttiſhe</hi> hyſtorie. For as touching <hi>Polydore</hi>
               <note place="margin">Polydore.</note> (though he were a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:151978:44"/> man ſingularly well learned) yet ſince hee was of our owne time, and no longer ſince, his forces muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be thought to bée bent, rather againſt the veritie, then againſt the antiquitie of that writing. Wherein if he ſhall ſeeke to diſcredit the whole worke, for that in ſome partes it conteineth matter, not only vnlikely, but incredible alſo: then ſhall he bothe depriue this Nation of all manner of knowledge of their firſt beginning, and open the way for vs alſo to cal into queſtion the origine, and antiquities of <hi>Spaine, Fraunce, Germanie,</hi> yea and of <hi>Italie</hi> his owne countrie: in which, that whiche <hi>Liuie</hi> reporteth of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus, Numa</hi> and <hi>Aegeria,</hi> is as farre remoued from all ſuſpicion of truthe, as any thing, whatſoeuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Galfride</hi> writeth, either of <hi>Brute, Merlin,</hi> or <hi>King Arthur</hi> himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Séeing therefore, that euen as corne hath his chaffe, and metall his droſſe, ſo can there harldly any wryter of the auncient hyſtorie of any nation be founde out that hath not his propre vanities mixed with ſincere veritie: the part of a wiſe Reader ſhalbe, not to reiect the one for doubt of the other, but rather with the fire and fan, of iudgement and diſcretion, to trie and ſift them a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

For <hi>Goodwine</hi> was Earle of <hi>Kent, Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, Hamſhire, Dorſetſhire, Deuonſhire,</hi> and <hi>Cornwal:</hi> His eldeſt ſonne <hi>Swane,</hi> had <hi>Oxfordſhire, Barkeſhire Glouceſterſhire, Herefordſhire,</hi> and <hi>Somerſet: Harold,</hi> helde <hi>Eſſex, Norfolk, Suffolke, Cambridgeſhire,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingdonſhire: Toſti,</hi> had <hi>Northumberland:</hi> And <hi>Gurte,</hi> &amp; <hi>Leoſwine,</hi> poſſeſſed other places. &amp;c.

So that immediatly, and at once, they pulled vpon their heades, the heauie diſpleaſure of the Prince, the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall hatred of the noble men, and the bitter execration
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:151978:57"/> and curſe of the common ſort. Whereupon the king for a ſeaſon baniſhed them, the nobles neuer after liked them, and the poore people not onely railed vpon them while they liued, but alſo by deuiſed tales (as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is) laboured to make them hatefull to all poſteritie after their death. And amongſt other things, touching <hi>Godwyne</hi> him ſelfe, they feygned, that he was choked at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> (or <hi>Windſore,</hi> as others ſay, for liers can not lightly agrée) with a morſel of bread, and that this his land in <hi>Kent</hi> ſonke ſodainly into the <hi>Sea.</hi> Neyther were theſe things continued in memory, by the mouths of the vnlearned people only, but committed to writing alſo, by the hands and pens of Monkes, Frears, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the learned ſort.

            <p>
               <hi>Silueſter Giraldus</hi> (in his <hi>Itinerarie</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi>) and many others, doe write,<note place="margin">The cauſe of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn Sandes</note> that about the end of the reigne of King <hi>William Rufus,</hi> (or the beginning of <hi>Henrie</hi> the firſt) there was a ſodaine and mightie inundation of the <hi>Sea,</hi> by the which a great part of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and of the lowe countries thereabout, was drenched, and loſt, ſo that many of the inhabitants (being thereby expulſed from their ſeates) came ouer into <hi>England,</hi> and made ſuite to the ſame King <hi>Henrie,</hi> for ſome place of dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling within his dominion. The King pitying their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and ſéeing that they might bee profitable to his Realme, by inſtructing his people in the art of clothing, (wherein at that time they chiefly excelled,) firſt placed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:151978:58"/> them about <hi>Carlile</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> countrie, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde (vpon cauſe) remoued them to <hi>Roſſe</hi> and <hi>Hauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> in <hi>Wales.</hi> Now at the ſame tyme that this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> the like harme was done in ſundry places, bothe of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> alſo, (as <hi>Hector Boethius,</hi> the <hi>Scottiſhe</hi> hyſtoriographer, moſte plainly writeth) affirming, that (amongſt other) this place, being ſometyme of the poſſeſſion of the Earle <hi>Godwine,</hi> was then firſt violently ouerwhelmed with a light ſande, wherewith it, not onely remayneth couered euer ſince, but is become withall <hi>(Nauium gurges, &amp; vorago)</hi> a moſt dreadfull gulfe, and ſhippe ſwalower.</p>
            <p>This thing, as I cannot but marueil how it hath eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the penns of our own countrie writers (the rather for that ſome of them liuing about that time) haue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that harme in the lowe countrie: ſo I ſticke not to accept it for aſſured trueth, conſidering either the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctority of the writer him ſelfe, being a diligent and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, or the circumſtances of the thing that he hathe left written, beeing in it ſelfe both reaſonable, &amp; likely.</p>
            <p>And thus I might wel make an end, but becauſe I haue alredy take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to accuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of forgerie, which affirme <hi>Godwine</hi> to haue bene choked at the bourde, I truſt it ſhalbe no great offence, (though beſide purpoſe, yet for declaration of the trueth) to rehearſe ſhortly, what ſome credible ſtoriers haue reported of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo.

            <p>But letting that and them paſſe, heare (I beſéech you) what <hi>Alfred</hi> of <hi>Beuerley</hi> (a learned man, that liued in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, ſomewhat before this Abbat <hi>Ealred</hi>) ſaith, touching this matter. <hi>Godwinus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui morbo ex improuiſo percuſſus, ac Regi ad menſam Wyntoniae aſsidens, mutus in ipſa ſede declinauit, ac poſtea in camera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis a filijs deportatus, moritur.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:151978:59"/> from his ſtoole, and was carried by his ſonnes into the Kings chamber, where he dyed: but ſome ſay that he was choked &amp;c.

               </hi> being taken with a grieuous diſeaſe, dropped down from the place where he ſate, and dyed within fiue houres after.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe men reporte another manner of his death, the one vſing no mention at all of any accurſed breade, and the other reciting it but as a tale.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1277"/> was afterward abandoned, and the now Towne buidled) was the firſt that appareiled them wyth that preeminence.</p>
            <p>By this therefore let it appeare, that <hi>Haſtings, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, Hithe, Rumney,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sandwiche,</hi> were the firſt Ports of priuiledge, which (bycauſe they were <hi>Fiue</hi> in numbre) bothe at the firſt gaue, and yet continue, to all the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, the name of <hi>Cinque Portes,</hi> although not onely <hi>Winchelſey</hi> and <hi>Rye,</hi> be ſince that time, incorporated with them as principals, but diuers other places alſo (for the eaſe of their charge) be crept in as partes, lims, and members of the ſame.

            <p>This Prelate, hauing nowe by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion the power of a <hi>Viceroy,</hi> and beſides, the <hi>Popes</hi> gifte, the authoritie of a Legate and Vicar, and conſequently, the exerciſe of both the ſwordes, ſo ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and reigned, ouer the Clergie &amp; Laitie in the kings abſence, that the one ſort founde him more then a <hi>Pope,</hi> the other felt him more then a King, and they bothe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured him an intollerable Tyrant: for he not only ouer ruled the Nobilitie, and outfaced the Clergie, ſpoyling bothe the one and the other, of their liuings and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for maintenaunce of his owne ryot, pompe, and exceſſe: But alſo oppreſſed the common people, deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and conſuming whereſoeuer he became, the victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the countrey, with the troupes and traines of men and horſes (being in number a thouſand or fiftéene hundreth) that continually followed him.

Whiche thing was done accordingly: for the Archebiſhop was no ſooner arriued, and entered the Churche, to offer to <hi>Sainct Martine,</hi> ſacrifice for his ſafe paſſage (as the Gentiles that eſcaped ſhipwracke, were wont to doe to <hi>Neptune:</hi>) But <hi>Clere</hi> and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie came in vpon him, and doing the <hi>Chancellours</hi> commaundement, violently haled him and his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines to priſon.</p>
            <p>Hereat <hi>Iohn</hi> (then the Kings brother, but afterward King) taking iuſt offence, and adioyning to him for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, the vttermoſt aide of the Biſhops and Barons, his friendes and alies, raiſed a great power, and in ſhort time ſo ſtrengthened the <hi>Chancellour,</hi> that he not only agreed to releaſe <hi>Godfrey,</hi> but was fayne him ſelfe alſo (abandoning his late pompe and glorie) to get him to <hi>Douer,</hi> and lye with his brother <hi>Clere,</hi> as a poore, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, and deſpoyled perſon.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, not thus able to endure long, the note of infamie and confuſion, whereinto he was falne, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined within him ſelf to make an eſcape, and by ſhift of the place, to ſhroud his ſhame, in ſome corner beyond the Seas: And therfore, ſhaueing his face, and attyring him ſelfe like a woman, he tooke a péece of linnen vnder his arme, and a yard in his hand, minding by that diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to haue taken veſſell amongſt other paſſingers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, &amp; ſo to haue gotten ouer: But he was not at the firſt, in al his authoritie, more vnlike a good man, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was now in this poore apparel vnlike an honeſt woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:

            <p>Thus ſhe continued by fittes, the ſpace of ſeuen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes, and more, and at the laſte, in the Moneth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember</hi> (at whiche time alſo a yong Childe of her Maiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters lay deſperatly ſicke in a cradle by her) ſhe being vexed with the former diſeaſe, aſked (with great pangs and groning) whether the Childe were yet departed this life, or noe: And when the women that attended vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them bothe in their ſickeneſſe, aunſwered no, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that it ſhould anone: whiche woord was no ſooner vttered, but the childe fetched a great ſighe, and withall the ſoule departed out of the body.</p>
            <p>This her diuination and foretelling, was the firſt matter, that moued her hearers to admiration: But
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:151978:91"/> after this, in ſundry of her fits following, althoughe ſhe ſeemed to the beholders to lye as ſtill as a deade body (not mouing any part at all) as well in the traunces themſelues, as after the pangs paſſed alſo, ſhe told plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of diuers things done at the Church, and other places where ſhe was not preſent, whiche neuertheleſſe ſhe ſéemed (by ſignes procéeding from her) moſt liuely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde (as it were) with her eye: She tolde alſo, of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, hell, and purgatorie, and of the ioyes, and ſorrowes, that ſundry departed ſoules had, and ſuffered there: She ſpake frankly againſte the corruption of manners and euill life: She exhorted repaire to the Churche, hearing of Maſſe, confeſſion to Prieſtes, prayer to our <hi>Lady</hi> and Sainctes, and to be ſhort, made in all pointes, confeſſion and confirmation of the Popiſh Créede and Catechiſme, and that ſo deuoutly and diſcretely (in the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mine authour) that he thought it not poſſible for her to ſpeake in that manner.</p>
            <p>But amongſt other things, this one was euer much in her mouthe, that <hi>She woulde goe home,</hi> and that ſhe had béene at home, whereas (to the vnderſtanding of the ſtanders by) ſhe had neuer béene from home, nor from the place where ſhe laye: wherevpon being (in a tyme of another traunce) demaunded where <hi>That home was,</hi> ſhe aunſwered, <hi>Where ſhe ſawe</hi> and hearde the ioyes of heauen, where <hi>S.

            <pb n="151" facs="tcp:151978:91"/>
            <p>Whiche wordes when her Maiſter heard, he ſayde, that there were no Belles at that Chappell, wherevnto the Mayden anſwered nothing, but the voice that ſpake in her procéeded, ſaying, <hi>Our bleſſed Lady wil ſhew moe miracles there ſhortly, for if any departe this life ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly, or by miſchance, in deadly ſinne, if he be vowed to our Lady heartely, he ſhal be reſtored to life againe, to receiue ſhrift, and houſell, and after to depart this worlde with Gods bleſsing.</hi> Beſides this, ſhe tolde them what meate the Heremite of that Chappell of our <hi>Lady at Court of Strete</hi> had to his ſupper, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things concerning him, whereat they maruailed greatly.</p>
            <p>And from that time forwarde, ſhe reſolued with her ſelfe, to goe to <hi>Court of Strete,</hi> and there to pray and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to our <hi>Lady,</hi> whiche alſo ſhe did accordingly: And was there delayde of her cure for a certaine ſeaſon, but yet (in the meane time) put in aſſured hope of recouerie. During whiche meane while, the fame of this maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Mayden was ſo ſpread abroade, that it came to the eares of <hi>Warham</hi> the Archebiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who directed thither Doctour <hi>Bocking,</hi> Maſter <hi>Hadleighe,</hi> and <hi>Barnes,</hi> thrée Monkes of <hi>Chriſtes</hi> Churche in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> father <hi>Lewes,</hi> and his fellowe, two obſeruants, his Officiall of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Parſon of <hi>Alding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> with commiſſion to examine the matter, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme him of the truthe.</p>
            <p>Theſe men oppoſed her of the chiefe pointes of the Popiſhe beliefe, and finding her ſounde therein, not only waded no further in the diſcouerie of the fraud, but gaue it great countenaunce, and ioyned with her in ſetting foorth of the ſame: So that at her nexte voyage to oure <hi>Lady of Court of Strete,</hi> ſhe entered the Chappell with <hi>Aue Regina Caelorum,</hi> in prickſong, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with theſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:151978:92"/> Commiſſioners, many Ladies, Gentlemen, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women of the beſt degrée, and thrée thouſande perſons beſides, of the common ſort of people.</p>
            <p>There fell ſhe eftſones into a marueilous paſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Image of our <hi>Lady,</hi> muche like a body diſeaſed of the falling Euill, in the whiche ſhe vttered, ſundrye metricall and ryming ſpeaches, tending to the worſhip of our <hi>Lady of Court of Strete</hi> (whoſe Chappell there, ſhe wiſhed to be better mainteined, and to be furniſhed with a dayly ſinging Prieſt) tending alſo to her owne beſtowing in ſome Religious houſe, for ſuche (ſayde ſhe) was our <hi>Ladies</hi> pleaſure, and to the aduauncement of the credite, of ſuche feyned miracles, as myne authour reporteth. This done and vnderſtoode to the Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, ſhe was by him appointed to <hi>S. Sepulcres,</hi> a houſe of Nonnes in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where ſhe laboured ſundry times of her diſeaſe, and continued her wonted working of wonderous myracles, reſorting ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (by way of trau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce onely) to our <hi>Lady of Court of Strete,</hi> who alſo ceaſſed not to ſhewe her ſelfe mightie in operation there, ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting candels without fire, moyſtning womens breaſtes that before were drye and wanted mylke, reſtoring all ſortes of ſicke to perfect healthe, reducing the deade to life againe, and finally doing all good, to al ſuche as were meaſured and vowed (as the manner was) vnto her at <hi>Court of Strete.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Elizabeth Barton</hi> was aduaunced from the condition of a baſe ſeruaunt, to the eſtate of a glorious Nonne. The Heremite of <hi>Court of Strete</hi> was enriched by dayly offring, <hi>S. Sepulchres</hi> got the poſſeſſion of a <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mayden, God</hi> was blaſphemed, the holy <hi>Virgine</hi> his mother miſhonoured, the ſilly people were miſerably mocked, The Biſhops, Prieſtes, and Monkes, in the meane time with cloſed eyes wincking, and the Deuill
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:151978:92"/> and his lymmes, with open mouthe laughing at it.</p>
            <p>And thus the matter ſtoode ſundry yeares together, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at length, the queſtion was moued about King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> marriage, at which time this holy Mayden (not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining her ſelfe within her former boundes of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie) ſtepped into this matter alſo, and feyned that ſhe vnderſtoode by reuelation, that if the King procéeded to the diuorce, he ſhoulde not be King of this Realme one moneth after: Wherevpon, her doings were once againe examined (not by men giuen ouer to beléeue illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but by ſuche as had the prudent power of prouing ſpirites) and in the ende her diſſimulation was deciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, her Popiſhe comforters were bewrayed, the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued people were well ſatiſfied, theſe daungerous decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers were worthely executed, and the Deuill their Maiſter was quite and cleane confounded.</p>
            <p>The circumſtances of all whiche doing, I doe of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe omit (knowing that it is in the ſtatute of <hi>.25.</hi>

            <p>So that now it néeded not <hi>Prometheus</hi> fire, to make it a liuely man, but onely the helpe of the couetous Prieſtes of <hi>Bell,</hi> or the ayde of ſome craftie College of Monkes, to deifie and make it paſſe for a very <hi>God.</hi>

            <p>This done, he made ſhifte for his libertie, came ouer into the Realme, of purpoſe to vtter his Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, and layde the Image vpon the backe of a Iade, that he draue before him. Nowe when he was come ſo farre as to <hi>Rocheſter</hi> on his waye, he waxed

            <p>This Iade was no ſooner out of ſight, but he miſſed the ſtreight weſterne way that his Maiſter intended to haue gone, and turning Southe, made a great pace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde <hi>Boxley,</hi> and being driuen (as it were) by ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine furie, neuer ceaſſed til he came at the Abbay church doore, where he ſo beate and bounced with his heeles, that diuers of the Monkes hearde the noyſe, came to the place to know the cauſe, and (marueiling at the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the thing) called the Abbat and his Couent to beholde it.</p>
            <p>Theſe good men ſeing the horſe ſo earneſt, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what he had on his backe, for doubt of deadly impietie opened the doore, whiche they had no ſooner done, but the horſe ruſhed in, and ranne (in great haſte) to a piller (which was the verie place where this Image was afterwarde aduaunced) and there ſtopped him ſelf, and ſtoode ſtill. Nowe while the Monkes were buſie to take off the loade, in commeth the Carpenter (that by great inquiſition had followed) and he chalengeth his owne: The Monkes, lothe to looſe ſo beneficiall a ſtray, at the firſt make ſome denyal, but afterwarde, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by all ſignes that he was the very Proprietarie, they graunt him to take it with him. The carpenter then taketh the horſe by the heade, and firſt aſſayeth to leade him out of the Churche, but he woulde not ſtirre for him: Then beateth he and ſtriketh him, but the Iade was ſo reſtie and faſt nayled, that he would not once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue his foote from the piller: At the laſte he taketh off the Image, thinking to haue carried it out by it ſelf, and then to haue led the horſe after, but that alſo cleaued ſo faſt to the place, that notwithſtanding all that euer he

            <p>If you minded to haue benefit by the Roode of <hi>Grace,</hi> you ought firſte to be ſhryuen of one of the Monkes: Then by lifting at this other Image (whiche was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly of the common ſorte called <hi>Sainct Grumbald,</hi> for <hi>Sainct Rumwald</hi>) you ſhoulde make proofe whether you were in cleane life (as they called it) or no: and if you ſo founde your ſelfe, then was your waye prepared, and your offering acceptable before the Roode, if not, then it behoued you to be confeſſed of newe,<note place="margin">For none might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Temple of Ceres in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuſis, but ſuch as were innocent.</note> for it was to be thought, that you had concealed ſomewhat from your ghoſtly Dad, and therefore not yet worthy to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Ad Sacra Eleuſina.</hi>

            <p>I omit, that chaſte Virgines, and honeſt marryed matrones, went oftentimes away with bluſhing faces, leauing (without cauſe) in the myndes of the lookers on, ſuſpicion of vncleane life, and wanton behauiour: for feare of whiche note and villanie, women (of all other) ſtretched their purſe ſtrings, and ſought by liberall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, to make <hi>Sainct Rumwalds</hi> man their good friend and Maiſter.</p>

            <p>Nowe during thoſe his troubles, amongſt other things that muche annoyed him, and furthered the part of <hi>Maude</hi> his aduerſarie, it was vpon a time ſounded (by his euil willers) in the eares of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort, that he was dead: And therewithall ſoudenly diuers great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1137"/> men of her deuotion, betooke them to their ſtrong holdes, and ſome others ſeiſed ſome of the Kings owne Caſtles to the behalfe of the Empreſſe: Of whiche number was <hi>Robert,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and baſtarde bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Maude,</hi> who entred this Caſtle of <hi>Leedes,</hi> myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to haue kept it.

            <p>And ſurely (omitting the reſidue of the Realme) hereof only it came to paſſe, that <hi>Douer</hi> had S. <hi>Martines, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury Chriſtes</hi> Churche, <hi>Rocheſter</hi> S. <hi>Andrewes, Tunbridge</hi> the Friars, <hi>Maydſtone</hi> the Chanons, <hi>Grenewiche</hi> the obſeruants, and this our <hi>Leedes</hi> her Pryorie of Chanons at hande. Howbeit, I finde in a Heralds note (who belike made his coniecture, by ſome coate of Armes lately apparant) that one <hi>Leybourne,</hi> an Earle of <hi>Salisburie,</hi> was the founder of it. In deede, it is to be ſéene in the <hi>Annales</hi> of S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> that a noble man (called <hi>Roger Leybourne</hi>) was ſometime of great authoritie within this Shyre, notwithſtanding that, in his time he had taſted of bothe fortunes: for in the dayes of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the thirde, he
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:151978:149"/> was firſte one of that coniuration, which was called the <hi>Barons warre,</hi> from whiche faction, <hi>Edwarde</hi> the Kings ſonne, wonne him, by faire means to his part, and made him the bearer of his priuie purſe.</p>
            <p>Afterwarde they agréed not vpon the reckoning, ſo that the Prince (charging him with great arrearage of account) ſeiſed his liuing for ſatiſfaction of the debt, by whiche occaſion <hi>Roger</hi> once more, became of the <hi>Barons</hi> deuotions: But after the pacification made at <hi>Kenel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> he was eftſones receiued to fauour, and was made Wardein of the <hi>Fiue Portes,</hi> and <hi>Lieuetenant</hi> of this whole Shyre. Nowe, thoughe it can not be true, that this man was the builder of this Pryorie (for the ſame <hi>Annales</hi> ſay, that it was erected long before) yet if he did but marrie the heyre, he might truely be termed the Patrone or founder thereof, for by that name, not only the builders themſelues, but their poſteritie alſo (to whom the glory of their déedes did deſcend) were wont to be called, as well as they.</p>

            <p>And therefore, of theſe ſuche excellent ornaments of peace, &amp; truſtie aides in warre, I might truely affirme, that they be for wealthe, almoſte ſo many riche treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as they be ſingle ſhips: for beautie, ſo many prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Palaces, as they be ſeuerall peices: and for ſtrength, ſo many mouing Caſtles, as they be ſundrie ſayling veſſels. They be not many (I muſt confeſſe, and you may ſée) and therefore in that behalfe nothing aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, either to that Nauie whiche fought againſt <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi> at <hi>Salamis,</hi> or to many other auncient Fleetes of Forreigne Kingdomes, or of this our owne <hi>Iland:</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,

For looke what the armed Hauke is in the aire amongſt the feareful Byrdes, or what the couragious Lyon is on the land amongſt the cowardly Cattell of the field, the ſame is one of theſe at the Sea in a Nauie of Common veſſels, beeing able to make hauocke, to plume, and to pray vpon the beſt of them at her owne pleaſure. Whiche ſpeache of mine, if any man ſhall ſuſpecte as <hi>Hyperbolical,</hi> let him cal to minde how often, and howe confidently (of late yeares) ſome fewe of theſe ſhips (incertaine of their interteine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) haue boorded mightie Princes Nauies of a great number of Sayle, and then I doubt not but he will chaunge his opinion. But what do I labour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, whiche not onely in ſhewe, and all reaſon, doe commend themſelues, but alſo are lyke in déedes and effect to perfourme more, then I, in woord or wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting can promiſe for them.

            <p>For, what time King <hi>Iohn</hi> had warre, with his Barons, they gotte the poſſeſſion of this Caſtle, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the defence therof to a noble man, called <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1215"/> Dalbinet,</hi> whome the king immediatly beſieged, &amp; (through the cowardiſe of <hi>Robert Fitz Walter,</hi> that was ſent to reſcue it) after thrée monethes labour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him to render the péece: The next yere after, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes</hi> (the Frenche Dolphine) by the ayde of the Engliſhe Nobilitie, entered the ſame Caſtle, and tooke it by force:</p>

This warre (as I haue partly ſhewed before) was ſpecially moued againſt ſtrangers, whiche during that kings reigne, bare ſuche a ſway (as ſome write) that they not onely diſdayned the naturall borne Nobilitie of the Realme, But did alſo (what in them lay) to aboliſhe the auncient lawes and cuſtomes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame.

But to return to <hi>Gundulphus,</hi> from whom I am by occaſion digreſſed: he (as I ſaid) réedified the great Church at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> erected the Pryorie, and where as he found but halfe a dozein ſecular Prieſtes in the Churche at his comming, he neuer ceaſed, till he had brought together at the leaſte thrée ſcore Monkes into the place.

            <p>By this meanes therefore, <hi>Gilbert</hi> became ſo hated of the Monkes, that when he died, they committed him obſcurely to the ground without ringing of Bell, Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of ſeruice, or dooing of any other funerall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1214"/> But to theſe their calamities, was alſo added one other great loſſe, ſuſteined by the warres of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who in his ſiege againſt the Caſtle of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi>

            <p>It was nowe highe time therefore, to deuiſe ſome way, whereby the Pryorie and Churche of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> might be, if not altogether reſtored to the auncient wealth and eſtimation, yet at the leaſt ſomewhat relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from this penurie, nakednes, and abiection.

He himſelf here calleth <hi>Aelfric,</hi> his Lord, &amp; natural Lord, &amp; ſaieth further, that <hi>Aelfere</hi> was Father to this <hi>Ael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fric:</hi> Now, what <hi>Aelfere</hi> &amp; <hi>Aelfric</hi> were, it is not hard to finde: for all our auncient Hyſtorians tell vs, that in the dayes of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Martyr, &amp; of King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> theſe men were by birth, couſines of the bloud royall: by ſtate <hi>(Eorles)</hi> which word we yet reteine in Engliſh, and which we commonly cal <hi>(Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes)</hi> in Latine, for that at the firſt they were parteners and companions (as I may ſay) with the <hi>King,</hi> in take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the profits of the <hi>Shyre,</hi> or <hi>Countie:</hi> that they were alſo by dignitie <hi>(Ealdormen)</hi> that is, <hi>Senators,</hi> and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of all <hi>Mercia,</hi> or midle England: And finally that they were of ſuch great power and credit, that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> the Father, immediatly after the death of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> reſtored al ſuch prieſts thorowout <hi>midle England,</hi> to their houſes, as the King (by aduice of <hi>Dunſtane</hi> the Monke) had in his lyfe expulſed, for the placeing of his Monks: And that <hi>Aelfric</hi> the ſonne, reſiſted king <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> in that ſiege of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> whereof you heard when we were there, For as much therefore, as <hi>Aelfric</hi> was <hi>Hlaford,</hi> or <hi>Lorde,</hi> to our Teſtator, and that <hi>Hla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Ðegn,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Lorde</hi> and <hi>Seruiteur,</hi> be woordes of relation, I gather that he was <hi>Ðegn,</hi> which ſignifieth properly a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> or frée <hi>Seruiteur,</hi> to the Kinge, or ſome great perſonage: but vſually at thoſe times taken for the verie ſame, that we call now of the Latine woord <hi>(Gentilis)</hi> a Gentleman, that is (<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Neither doth it detract any thing from his Gentrie at al, that I ſaid he was a Miniſter, or Seruiteur: For I meane not thereby, that he was <hi>(Seruus)</hi> whiche woord (ſtraightly conſtrued) doth ſignifie a ſeruaunt, or ſlaue, whome they in thoſe daies called <hi>ðeoƿe:</hi> but my minde is, that hee was a ſeruitour of frée condition, either ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced by his owne vertue and merite, or els deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of ſuche Aunceſtours, as were neuer degraded: And that name, the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> or eldeſt Sonne of our King of this Realme, doth not, in the life of his Father, diſdaine to beare: For, out of the very ſame olde-woord <hi>(Ðenian)</hi> to ſerue, is framed his Poeſie, or word vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his armes <hi>(ic Dien)</hi> I ſerue. And thus I ſuppoſe that it is manifeſt, that <hi>Byrthryc</hi> our Teſtator was by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition a Noble man, or (whiche in common acceptance abroade is all one with it) a Gentleman. Howbeit, to the ende, that bothe this thing may haue the more authoritie and credit, and that it may withall appeare, what degrees of Nobilitie and Gentrie there were in this Realme before the comming in of the <hi>Normanes,</hi> and by what merites men might aſcend, and be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſame, I will reache a litle higher, and ſhewe you another <hi>Engliſhe</hi> (or <hi>Saxon</hi>) antiquitie, whiche I haue ſéene placed, in diuers olde copies of the <hi>Saxon</hi> lawes, after the end of all, as a note or aduertiſement.</p>

It appeareth by the authors of that worke, that after ſuche time as the King and the Biſhop had long contended (and that with great heate) about the Statutes of <hi>Clarendune,</hi> &amp; that the Biſhop, vpon great offence taken, had made thrée ſeuerall attempts to croſſe the Seas towarde the Pope, and was alwayes by contrarie winde repulſed, and driuen to the lande againe: The King in his iuſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, ſought by all poſſible meanes to bridle his immoderate peuiſhneſſe: &amp; therefore, firſt reſumed into his owne handes, al ſuch honors and caſtles of his own as he had committed to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Biſhops cuſtodie: The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called he an aſſembly of al his Nobilitie &amp; biſhops to <hi>Northa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ton</hi> caſtle, where before them all, he firſt charged <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> with <hi>.500.</hi> l. that he had long before lent him: for the repaiment wherof, he ther co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled him to giue fiue ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral ſureties: This done, he called him to an account for <hi>.30000.</hi> Markes, receiued of the reuenues of the crown, during the time that he was Chancelour.

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:151978:208"/> crauing reſpite to make a reſolute aunſwere, but alwayes delaying the time, and meditating howe to ſhifte the place) there commeth (on a time) into his lodging, the Biſhops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Chicheſter:</hi> who, finding him at ſupper, ſayde vnto him (worde for worde of the <hi>Quadriloge</hi>) as followeth, that is, <hi>That they had founde out a way for peace: and when the Archebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop had required, vnder what forme, they anſwered: There is a queſtion for money betweene you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Manor of Wingha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
               <hi>and the King: If therefore you will aſsigne vnto the King, your two Manors, Otford and Wingham in the name of a pledge, we beleue that he being therwith pacified, will not only reſigne you the Manors againe, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue you the money, but alſo a great deale the ſooner receiue you to his fauour.</hi> To this, the Archebiſhop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>The manor of Heche was ſomtime belonging to the Church of Canterburie (as I haue hard) which the King now hath in demeane: And albeit that the only challenge of the thing is ſufficient cauſe to haue it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the Church of Canterbury, yet I do not loke that it will be doone in theſe times: Neuertheleſſe, rather then I wil renounce the right, which the church of Canterbury is ſayd to haue in that Manor, either for the appeaſing of any trouble whatſoeuer, or for recouerie of the Kings fauour, I will offer this head of mine (and touched it) to any hazarde or daunger, what ſoeuer it be:</hi> The Biſhops being angrie with this, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out from him, and tolde the King of all, and his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſore kindled with it. Thus muche out of the <hi>Quadriloge</hi> faithfully tranſlated. Nowe, vpon the whole matter it appeareth: firſt, that the quarell was for the lawes of <hi>Clarendùne</hi> (whiche yet depended) and then, that, euen as a fire, being once kindled, the flame ſéeketh all about, and imbraceth whatſoeuer it findeth
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:151978:208"/> in the way: So the King being offended with the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of this Biſhop, left no ſtone vntaken vp, that might be hurled at him, &amp; therefore brought in againſt him, bothe debts, accompts, and whatſoeuer other meanes of annoyaunce. Moreouer, that this matter of <hi>Otford</hi> and <hi>Wingham</hi> (for as you nowe ſée it was not <hi>Otford</hi> alone) was not at all toſſed betwéene the King and the Archebiſhop, but only moued by the pacifiers (theſe two Biſhops) as a méete meane of reconciliation, in their owne opinion and iudgement: or, if it may be thought, that they were ſent and ſuborned by the King himſelfe with that deuiſe: yet is it manifeſt, that the right of the houſes themſelues were not deſired, but onely that they might remaine as a paine till the account were audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Neither if the gifte of this houſe would haue made an end of the ſtrife, doth it by and by followe, that the contention was moued at the firſt about it. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as on the one ſide you may ſée, that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> his reporte is but matter of Preface and no Goſpell: So yet on the other ſide it is euident, that of ſuch and ſo luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie a ſtomacke was this Archebiſhop, that if former cauſe had not béene, yet he could haue found in his hart to fall out with his Prince for this, or a ſmaller matter.</p>
            <p>For, what would he not aduenture for a Manor or twaine in lawfull poſſeſſion, that would not ſticke to hazard his head before he would releaſe that right, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he thought he had to a piece of land, and that but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by heareſay, or ſuppoſition?

            <p>It is noted of that man, that he was in all his life and Port, ſo gay &amp; glorious, that the Nobility of the Realme diſdained him greatly therefore. But they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider (belike) that he was in poſſeſſion Biſhop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> which had <hi>Iura Regalia,</hi> the Prerogatiues of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Kingdome, and that he was by election, Patriarche of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> whiche is néere Couſin to a Popedome, in whiche reſpectes he might well inoughe be allowed to haue <hi>Domus ſplendidas luxu Regali,</hi> his houſes not only as gay as the Noble mens, but alſo as gorgeous as the

To ſay the trueth, this was not to builde vp the ſpirituall houſe with liuely ſtones, reſting on the chiefe corner to Heauen, and to Godward, but with Mammon and Material ſtuffe to erect warrelyke Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles for the nouriſhment of contention: and ſtately Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, for the maintenaunce of worldly pride and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, towardes Hell and the Deuill.

            <p>King <hi>Henrie</hi> the third (ſaith <hi>Mat.

For I doe not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gather, that hitherto the King had any property in it, foraſmuch as the Princes in thoſe days, vſed common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both to ſoiourne for their pleaſures, and to paſſe their ſet ſolemnities alſo in Abbaies and Biſhops houſes.</p>
            <p>But yet I beléeue verely, that ſoone after the deathe of that Biſhop, the houſe came to the poſſeſſion of the Crowne: for proofe wherof, I pray you heare and marke what followeth.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough good order would haue borne the reherſall of the Auncient Cuſtomes of this Shyre, in that generall diſcourſe whiche we had in the beginning as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the eſtate of this whole Countie, the rather for that it was there ſhewed by what meanes and policie they were conſerued: yet, leaſt the recitall of the ſame (being of themſelues large and manyfolde) might haue béene thought too great a <hi>Parentheſis,</hi> or rather an interruption of the Hyſtorie, wherein we were as then but newly entred, I thought it better to reſerue them for this place, to the end, that bothe the one and the other, might appeare, without breache, or confuſion.</p>
            <p>Theſe Cuſtomes, therefore, being (for the moſt part) diſcrepant from the common lawes of our Realme, and annexed to ſuche landes within this Shyre, as beare the name of <hi>Gauelkinde,</hi> are commonly called <hi>Gauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde Cuſtomes,</hi> for that they preuaile and haue place, in landes of <hi>Gauelkinde</hi> nature. In whiche reſpect, it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſhewe, for what reaſon thoſe landes were at the firſt ſo termed, and why they do yet hitherto continue the name.</p>
            <p>Two coniectures I haue of the reaſon of this name, the one grounded vpon the nature of the diſcent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of theſe landes themſelues: the other founded vpon the manner of the duetie and ſeruices, that they yeald: bothe whiche I will not ſticke to recite, and yet leaue to eache man frée choice, to receaue either, or to refuſe bothe, as it ſhall beſt lyke him.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The name Gauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it aroſe.</note>I gather by <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> and others, that the auncient <hi>Germans,</hi> (whoſe ofſpring we be) ſuffred their landes to deſcend, not to the Eldeſt Sonne alone, but to the whole number of their male Children: &amp; I finde in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>75.</hi> Chap. of <hi>Canutus</hi> law (a King of this Realme before
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:151978:212"/> the Conqueſt) that after the death of the father, his heires ſhoulde diuide bothe his goods, and his landes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. Nowe, for as muche as all the nexte of the kinred did this inherite together, I coniecture, that therfore the land was called, eyther <hi>Gauelkyn,</hi> in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Giueall kyn,</hi> bycauſe it was giuen to all the nexte in one line of kinred: or <hi>Giue all kynd,</hi> that is, to all the male children: for <hi>kynd,</hi> in Dutche, ſignifieth yet a male childe: Beſides this, the Welſhmen alſo (who but now lately loſt this cuſtome) doe in their language call this diſcent, <hi>Gwele,</hi> and in their Latine Recordes, <hi>Lectus, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genies, &amp; gauella,</hi> of their owne worde, <hi>Gefeilled,</hi> whiche ſignifieth <hi>Twyns,</hi> or ſuche as be borne together, bicauſe they doe all inherite together, and make (as it were) but one heire, and not many. And here (by the way) I cannot omit to ſhew, that they of this our <hi>Kentiſh</hi> cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,<note place="margin">To ſhift la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is an olde terme.</note> do yet cal their partition of land (ſhifting) euen by the very ſame worde that the lawe of <hi>Canutus</hi> many yeares ſince termed it, namely <hi>(Scyftan)</hi> in Latine, <hi>Herciſcere,</hi> that is, to ſhift, depart, or diuide lande.</p>
            <p>My other coniecture, is rayſed vpon the conſideration of the rent and ſeruices going out of theſe landes: for it is wel knowne, that as <hi>Knights ſeruice</hi> lande, required the preſence of the tenant, in warfare and battaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: So this lande (being of <hi>Socage</hi> tenure) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his attendance at the ploughe, and other the Lordes affaires of huſbandry, at home: the one by manhoode de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending his Lords life and perſon, the other by induſtrie mainteining with rent, corne, and victuall, his eſtate and familie. This rent, and cuſtomarie payment of works, the Saxons called, <hi>gafol,</hi> and therof (as I think) they named the lande that yealded it, <hi>gafolette,</hi> or <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folcynd.</hi> that is to ſaye, lande <hi>Letten for rent,</hi> or of the kinde to yealde rent. In this ſenſe I am ſure, that the
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:151978:213"/> rents, cuſtomes, and ſeruices, whiche the tenantes of London pay to their land lords, were wont (and yet are) to be recouered, by a writ, thereof called <hi>Gauellet,</hi> as by an auncient ſtatute, made in the tenthe yeare of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, intituled, <hi>Statutum de Gaueleto,</hi> in London, and by dayly experience there, it may well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.

Yea, ſo inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is this cuſtome from the lande in whiche it obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that a contrarie diſcent (continued in the caſe of the Crowne it ſelfe) can not hinder, but that (after ſuch time as the lande ſhall reſorte agayne to a common perſon) the former inueterate cuſtome ſhall gouerne it. As for the purpoſe.

In whiche caſe, althoughe thoſe landes whiche the eldeſt ſonne (being King) did poſſeſſe, doe come to his eldeſt ſonne after him (being King alſo) and ſo from one to another, by ſundry diſcents: Yet the opinion of Syr <hi>Anthonie Browne</hi> was. <hi>7.

            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">The cuſtome of Gauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall in Kent.</note>It is commonly taken therefore, that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of <hi>Gauelkind</hi> is generall, and ſpreadeth it ſelfe throughout the whole Shyre, into all landes ſubiect by auncient tenure vnto the ſame, ſuch places only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, where it is altered by acte of Parleament.

            <p>But here, before I conclude this part, I thinke good firſt to make Maiſter <hi>Litletons</hi> aunſwere to ſuche as happely wil demaund, what reaſon this cuſtome,<note place="margin">The reaſon of Gauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</note> of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelkinde</hi> diſcent hathe, thus to diuide land amongſt al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Males, contrarie to the manner of the whole Realme beſides.

But, as neither the Lorde ought to take any thing for the cuſtody, neither to tender to the Heire any marriage at all: So muſt he take good héede, that he credit not the cuſtodie to any perſon, that ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to anſwere therefore. For if the Heire, at his full age of fifteene yeares, ſhall come to the Lordes Court, and demaunde his inheritance, although the Lord may diſtreine the Gardien to yeelde his accompt (as it appeareth. <hi>18. E. 2. Auowrie. 220.</hi> Yet in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulte
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:151978:220"/> of his abilitie, the Lord himſelfe, and his Heires, remaine charged to the Heire for the the ſame.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, if the Tenant ſhall withdrawe from the Lord his due rents, and ſeruices, the cuſtome of this Countrie giueth to the Lorde, a ſpeciall, and ſolemne kinde of <hi>Ceſſauit,</hi> and that after this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ceſſauit, in Gauelkind.</note>The Lord, after ſuche a Ceſſing, ought by award of his thrée wéekes Courte, to ſéeke (from Courte to Court, vntill the fourth Court) in the preſence of good witneſſe, whether any diſtreſſe may be found vpon the Tenement, or No: And if he can finde none, then at the fourth Courte it ſhalbe awarded, that he ſhall take the Tenement into his handes, as a diſtreſſe, or pledge, for the Rent and ſeruices, withdrawne, and that he ſhall deteine it one yeare and a day, without manuring it: within whiche time, if the tenant come, and make agréement with the Lord for his arrerage, he ſhall enter into his tenement againe: but if he come not within that ſpace, then at the next Countie Courte the Lord ought openly to declare all that his former procéeding, to the end that it may be notorious: which being done, at his owne Courte, next following the ſaide Countie, it ſhalbe finally awarded, that he may enter into that Tenement, and manure it as his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per demeane.</p>
            <p>And that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forfaiture, due to the Lord for this ceaſſer of his Tenant, was fiue pounds (at the leaſt) beſides the arrerages: it doeth well appeare by the olde <hi>Kentiſhe</hi> by word, recited in the often remembred treatiſe of theſe Cuſtomes.</p>

            <p>That is to ſay, <hi>Hathe he not ſince any thing giuen? nor hathe he not ſence any thing payd? Then let him pay fiue pound for his were, before he become tenant, or holder againe:</hi> But ſome copies haue the firſt verſe thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nigond ſithe ſeld, and nigon ſithe gelde:</hi> That is, <hi>Let him nine times pay, and nine times repay.</hi> And here (by the way) it is to be noted, that this word (were) in olde time ſignified, the value, or price of a mans lyfe, eſtimation, or countenance: For, before the Conqueſt, each man in the Realme was valued at a certain ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of money, hauing regarde to his degrée, condition, and woorthineſſe, as is more at large ſhewed in the Table to the tranſlation of the <hi>Saxon</hi> lawes, wherevnto for this purpoſe I will ſend you.

            <p>But nowe, as theſe aduantages ariſe to the Lorde from his Tenant: So on the other ſide, the Lord alſo ought to ſuffer his Tenant to enioy the benefite of ſuch cuſtomes as make for his auaile. And therefore, firſt he ought to let him alien his land at his owne pleaſure, without ſuing to him for licence: He ought alſo to be contented with one ſuite to his Court for one tenement althoughe the ſame happen to be diuided amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: of verie right alſo he ought to admit an <hi>Eſſoine,</hi> if any be caſt for the Tenant, whether it be in a cauſe of <hi>Plainte,</hi> or for common ſuite to his Courte: And laſtlie he may not exacte of him any manner of othe, other then that of <hi>Fidelitie,</hi> whiche groweth due by reaſon of his Tenure.<note place="margin">Tenant by the Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And thus leauing the Lorde and his Tenant, let vs
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:151978:221"/> come to the huſband and the wife, and firſt ſhew what courteſie the huſband ſhal finde by order of this cuſtome after the death of his wife that was ſeiſed of landes of <hi>Gauelkind</hi> tenure: and then what benefite the wife may haue after the deceaſe of her Huſband dying ſeaſed of Landes of the ſame kinde and nature.</p>
            <p>The Huſband (ſaith our treatiſe of <hi>Gauelkind</hi> Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome) ſhall haue the one halfe of ſuche <hi>Gauelkind</hi> land, wherein his wife had eſtate of inheritance, whether he had iſſue by her or no: And ſhall holde the ſame during ſo long time, as he wil kéepe him ſelfe widower, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married. For if he marrie, he looſeth all. Neither may he committe any waſte, more then Tenant by the courteſie at the common lawe, may. So that one way (namely, in that he ſhall haue his wiues land for lyfe thoughe he neuer had iſſue by her) this our Cuſtome is more courteous then the common lawe: but an other way, (I meane in that he ſhall haue but the one halfe, and that with a prohibition of ſecond marriage) it is loſſe beneficiall.

               </hi>) is in a ſorte borne and abidden, Seing that by this cuſtome, ſhe forfeiteth not in this later caſe, vnleſſe the childe be borne, and heard to crye, and that of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey people, aſſembled by hue and crye: For then (ſayth the cuſtome)

            <p>And thus the cuſtome, making like eſtimation of both the caſes, depriueth her of her liuing, as well for honeſt marriage, as for filthy fornication. In whiche behalfe, as I muſt néedes confeſſe, that the later condition hath reaſon, bycauſe it tendeth (though not fully) to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of ſinne and wickedneſſe: So yet dare I affirme, that the former is not onely not reaſonable, but meerely leud and irreligious alſo. For, although the Ethnickes did ſo much magnifie wydowhood, that (as <hi>Valerius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth) <hi>Faeminas, quae vno matrimonio contentae erant, corona pudicitiae honorabant,</hi> and although that the common law alſo (being directed by the Popiſhe Clergie, whiche ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in followed the errour of <hi>Ierome</hi>) dothe in another caſe, by the name of <hi>Bigamie,</hi> diſlike of a womans ſeconde marriage: Yet Sainct <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth plainely, <hi>Mulier, ſi dormierit maritus eius, libera est, vt cui vult nubat, modò in Domino.</hi> But yet for all this, ſéeing that our treatiſe of vſages reciteth it, ſéeing alſo that common experience of the countrey approueth it, and that the common lawe
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:151978:222"/> of the Realme (as it may be read, <hi>Praerogatiua Regis Cap. 16. &amp; <hi>2. H. 3. in Praeſcription. 59.</hi>
               </hi>) admitteth it: let vs alſo for this place and purpoſe, be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to number it amongſt our cuſtomes, and ſo procéed with the reſidue. It appeareth, by that whiche is already ſayde, that the common lawe, and this cuſtome, differ in two things concerning Dower: One, in that the common lawe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth but a thirde parte, whereas the cuſtome vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth the halfe: Another, in that this cuſtome giueth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally, whereas the gifte of the common lawe, is frée and abſolute. Nowe therefore, there remaine to be ſhewed, certeine other pointes, wherein they varie alſo. As, if the huſband commit Felonie: at the common law, his wife hath loſt her title of Dower, but by the cuſtome of this countrey, ſhe ſhall not looſe her Dower for the faulte of her huſbande, but only in ſuche caſe, where the heire ſhall looſe his inheritance, for the offence of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Which thing is manifeſt, both by the treatiſe of our <hi>Kentiſhe</hi> cuſtomes, and by the opinion of the <hi>Court 8. H. 3. Praeſcription. 60.</hi> At the common lawe alſo, the wife ſhall be endowed of a poſſeſſion in lawe, but (as me thinketh) ſhe ſhall haue no Dower by this cuſtome, but onely of ſuche landes, whereof her huſband was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and really ſeiſed. For the wordes be <hi>(Des tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, dount ſon Baron moruſt ſeiſet, et vestu,)</hi> which word <hi>(vestu)</hi> being cleane omitted in the imprinted booke, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth a poſſeſſion in déede, and not in lawe only. And therefore, if landes in <hi>Gauelkinde</hi> deſcend to a married man, whiche dyeth before he make his entrie into the ſame, inquire whether it be the manner to endowe his wife therof, or no: for vſe is the only <hi>Oracle</hi> that in this caſe I can ſende you vnto. Againe, at the common law, a woman ſhal be endowed of a faire, or of any ſuch other profit. But, (for as muche as the wordes of this
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:151978:222"/> cuſtomarie Dower, be <hi>(terres &amp; tenements)</hi> and for that all cuſtomes ſhall finde a literall and ſtreight interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) the opinion of Maiſter <hi>Parkins</hi> is, that no Dower lyeth of a faire, by this cuſtome. Furthermore, if the wife recouer her Dower at the common law, ſhe ought of neceſſitie to be endowed by metes and boundes: But in Dower after this cuſtome (ſayth the ſame authour) ſhe may very well be endowed of a moitie, to be holden in common with the heire, that inioyeth the other half. Laſtly, this cuſtome, beſides Dower of the one halfe of the huſbandes lande,<note place="margin">Dower of chattels.</note> prouideth Dower of the moitie of ſuche goods alſo, as he dyed poſſeſſed of, if he had no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and of the thirde part, though he leaue iſſue: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the common lawe (at the leaſt in common practiſe at this day) hath no conſideration of any ſuche endowme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Theſe then be the differences, betwéene the common lawe of the Realme, and the particular cuſtome of this countrey concerning Dower: the compariſon whereof, and whether ſort of Dower is more beneficiall, I will not now attempt, and much leſſe take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, leaſt I my ſelfe might ſéeme raſhly to preiudicate in another thing, wherin I moſt gladly deſire to be iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by other men: namely, whether a woman, intituled to Dower in <hi>Gauelkind,</hi> may waine her Dower of the moitie after this cuſtome, and bring her action to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed of the thirde at the common lawe, and ſo exempt her ſelfe from all danger of theſe cuſtomarie conditions, or no? The Reſolution of whiche doubte, will depend chiefly vpon compariſon, whether it be more aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to her, to haue the thirde at the common lawe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, or the moitie by the cuſtome conditionally.</p>
            <p>For if the Dower at the common law be better for her, then it ſéemeth reaſonable that ſhe ſhould ſtande to the worſe, whiche is the cuſtome: euen as tenant by the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:151978:223"/> curteſie, muſt take the moitie that the cuſtome giueth, and not aſke the whole, as Common lawe appointeth.</p>
            <p>And yet thereto it may be replyed, that the caſes be not like: for ſo muche as that of <hi>Dower</hi> is much more to be fauoured. I my ſelfe once heard two reuerend Iudges of opinion, that the woman was at libertie, to aſke her Dower of the Thirde, or of the Moitie: But bycauſe it was vttered by them in a paſſage of ſoudaine ſpeache, and not ſpoken vpon ſtudied argument, I will not vſe the authoritie of their names, to get the matter credite with all, but leaue it at large, to be better inquired of.</p>

<pb n="412" facs="tcp:151978:225"/> at all, althoughe a leaſe with releaſe might happely be good by the Cuſtome, bicauſe that amounteth to a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offment. And, in my ſimple iudgement, it is not fit that this Cuſtome ſhould be conſtrued by equitie, for as muche as it ſtandeth not with any equitie, to enable an infant, of litle diſcretion, and leſſe experience, to ſell his land, and not to prouide withal that he ſhould haue, <hi>Quid pro quo,</hi> and ſome reaſonable recompence for the ſame: for that were, not to defend the Pupill and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therles, but to lay him wyde open to euery ſlye deceipt, and circumuention. In whiche reſpect, I cannot but very well like of their opinion,<note place="margin">Sale good at. 15. yeares</note> who holde, that if an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant in <hi>Gauelkinde,</hi> at this day will ſell at xv. yeares of age, theſe thrée things ought of neceſſitie to concurre, if he will haue the ſale good and effectuall.

And theſe men for proofe of the firſt and ſecond point of their aſſertion, doe builde vpon the wordes of our written Cuſtome, where it is ſaide <hi>Del heure que ceux heirs de Gauelkinde, ſoient, ou ount paſſe lage de. 15. ans, liſt a eux, lour terres &amp; te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nementes, Doner &amp; Vender</hi>) in whiche, the wordes <hi>(Ceux Heires)</hi> doe reſtraine the Infant that commeth in by Purchaſe: And <hi>(Doner &amp; Vender)</hi> in the copulatiue, (for ſo they lye in déede, though the imprinted booke haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſiunctiuely) doe of neceſſitie implye a recompence, for as muche as, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>endere,</hi> cannot be <hi>Sine precio.</hi> And for maintenance of the third matter, they haue on their part, beſides the common vſage of their owne Countrie, the common lawe of the whole Realme alſo: which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth the word <hi>(Doner)</hi> to meane a Feoffment (as
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:151978:225"/> I haue before ſhewed) and whiche not onely diſaloweth of any gifte made by an infant, but alſo puniſheth the taker in treſpas, vnleſſe he haue it by liuerie from the infantes owne handes.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I runne ouer ſuche cuſtomes, as by meane of this <hi>Gauelkinde</hi> tenure doe apperteine, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Lorde or the Tenant, the huſbande or the wife, the childe or the Gardein: To theſe I will adde (as I promiſed) confuſedly, a fewe other things, of the whiche, ſome belong generally to the <hi>Kentiſhe</hi> man throughout the whole Shyre: Some to the inhabitants of ſome particular quarter of the countrie: and ſome to the tenants in <hi>Gauelkinde</hi> onely, and to none other.</p>
            <p>It appeareth,<note place="margin">No villains in Kent.</note> by claime made in our auncient trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, that the bodyes of all <hi>Kentiſhe</hi> perſons be of frée condition, whiche alſo is confeſſed to be true <hi>.30.
